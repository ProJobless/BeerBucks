#Beer-Bucks v0.1.0
###A convenient method for allowing multiple people to pitch-in to throw a party.

Beer-Bucks also has community features like the ability to add your friends, submit pictures, and have discussions. 

Adding your friends lets you see which parties they pitch in for, and any parties that they start. 

You can pitch in for any party, and by doing so you will get the location to the party.

Beer-Bucks is a social site for people that love to party.
